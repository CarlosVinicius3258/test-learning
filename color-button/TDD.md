# TDD (Test-Driven Development)

- Write tests before writing code
  - then write code according to spec set by tests
  - red-green testing
    - Tests fail before code is written
  ## Why?
  - Makes a huge difference in how it feels to write tests
    - part of the coding process, not a "chore" to do at the end
  - More Efficient
    - Re-run tests "for free" after changes 
## Difference between TDD vs BDD
  - BDD: Behavior-Driven Development
    - testing Library encourages testing behavior over implemanteation
    - Very explicitly defined
      - involves collaboration between lots of roles
        - developers, testers, business analysts, product owners, etc.
      - defines process for different groups to interact
